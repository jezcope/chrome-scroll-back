# Chrome Scroll Back extension

This is a very simple Chrome extension that replicates a little-known feature of Firefox: if you hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and use the mouse wheel, you can go forward and backward in your browser history.

The idea came from [issue 927 on the Chromium bug tracker][issue 927], which is a request for this very feature.
